During this time, we will make all of the appropriate arrangements to

entire work day, but we hope to complete the work much more quickly than
that.

Service provider staff: If there are any tickets that can be closed in the old system before this
cut over date, please do your best to complete them.  Ideally, we would
like to minimize the number of tickets that need to live in both systems.
To be clear, all tickets which remain open in the old system will be
transferred to the new system on May 20.

Once the new system comes up, the old system will still be available for
some time, but we expect that you will be able to do all of your work from
the new system.

Should you have any questions, please let us know.

During this time, the base Linux operating system will be upgraded from CentOS 6.3 to CentOS 6.4. In addition, the corresponding Intel Xeon Phi software stack will be upgraded to the latest revision to support acceptance testing efforts underway for the Xeon Phi co-processor subsystem.

As a reminder, please recall that Stampede is the first large-scale deployment of Intel's new Xeon Phi co-processors.  The base compute system -- Dell PowerEdge nodes with Xeon E5 (Sandy Bridge) processors, NVIDIA K20 GPUs, Mellanox FDR interconnect, and Lustre file systems -- entered production operation on January 7th.  Since then, the Xeon Phi co-processor subsystem has continued to be deployed with a subset made available to users for early access development and testing. Acceptance testing for for the Xeon Phi co-processor subsystem will continue during June and July and we encourage users to contact TACC consulting with any issues encountered with the latest runtime environment. A follow on announcement will be made when the Xeon Phi subsystem has been formally accepted indicating the availability of the entire subsystem for standard production usage by users.
